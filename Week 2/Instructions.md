1) use debug to show tracing 2.1.1 
2) implement O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(2^n) & O(n!)  ( you can leverage math library when you build each function )
3) use some small data sets to prove or disapprove the sorting order above
4) apply a sorting alglrithm to confirm your manual finding (for example: create a small set of strings ( book titles) in no particular order. pass the list of book titles to your sorting algorithm. verify the output against your expected order)
The submission is strongly preferred to git, paste your github link to the corresponding  assignment page on BB. A less preferred way is for you to paste the code ( with proper delineation amongst the exercises ) directly to the BB.
5) modify either merge sort or quick sort ( refer to Student Resources section ) to sort letters.
